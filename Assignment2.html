        <h1>Worldwide Happiness Scores</h1>
         <font size="+1"><p>The score is an index derived from the responses to the "Gallup World Survey", this survey is conducted in each country and has a sample
          size of around 1000 individuals. It asks participants various life questions which relate to the country they live in,
          <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/faq/" target="_blank">World Happiness Report</a> then summarises the results into six factors 
          being Gross Domestic Profit , life expectancy, generosity, social support , freedom and corruption and use these to give each country a 
          single value where higher values reflect a happier country and lower values being a less happier one</p>

        <p>This page shows a collection of visualisations to show the difference in Happiness scores between regions, and how Australia has performed 
          througout the years. A handful of visualisations will also show the trends and relationships between the main factors that go into calculating
          the score.</p></font>

          <h2>Composition?</h2>
          <p>Happiness Scores are derived from the results obtained from each of the 6 factors, and summed together using
            a weighting system <a href="https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup</a>.</p>
          <p>The visualisation to the right shows the score of a selection of 9 countries, using the 4 highest weighted factors, where
            for example Freedom relates to a individuals level of choice in making decisions in their lives. the sum of factors is not
            the happiness score of the country but rather cumulative score of the 4 factors. Users can select the factors they want to
            compare using drop down box, and graph is sorted in descending order for easy comparison.</p>
          <p>Generally "Western" countries dominated the scores, however its interesting to see how countries like Bulgaria can gain a 
            higher score than China, even though their GDP is much smaller at 84.32 billion in 2022, while China had 20.25 trillion, 
            however all factors are weighted with other measurements, hence even with this big difference Bulgaria had a better score.</p>

        <h2>A Comparison</h2>
        <p>Now having insight with how the scores are calculated, lets see how Australia's score compares with the rest of the world,
           And if certain regions perform better than others.</p>

          <p>The line chart on the left compares australia's Happiness scores with the world and 4 other countries
            from different regions from the years 2015-2022. Click on the country drop down box to see line trend of
            one country, and also toggle with the slider to set boundary on year range.<p>

        <p>The boxplot on the right, aims to show the distribution of Happiest Scores depending on the region, Since there
          is a variable number of countries between the regions and a variance of scores, users will be able to see how a 
          regions data is skewed, and with using region selection drop box,  readers will be able to investigate the shape 
          of the plots more as the axis will also zoom in. </p>

          <p>A comparison between Australia and countries of various regions is good as it shows a more complete picture of 
            the significance of Australia's score. Australia has high scores in all the major factors such as in 2022 received
            a weighted score of 1.9 for Gross Domestic Profit and 1.203 for social support in 2022. which can be explained by 
            Australia's high supply of raw minerals per capita and its health care and social support systems such as Medicare
            and Centrelink, which both of whom provide more assurances to population and improve happiness scores. While Australia'
            s scores have remained relatively stable, countries like Ecuador have dipped since 2019 whereas in the same year Iraq
            has improved. </p>
          <p>The boxplots are interesting as while Australia New Zealand have a very small box plot due to only 2 countries being 
            in the region, with similar scores. Middle East and North Africa was extremely variable as, the region included countries
            like Israel and Bahrain who have high socio economic statutes and well developed, but also countries like Lebanon and Yemen
            who have ongoing conflicts and recessions. </p>

        <h2>Economic Factors</h2>
        <p>The Visualisation below shows the correlation between Happiness Scores and its the 2 main economic factors that constitute
          it being Gross Domestic Profit and Social Support. Happiness Scores are sized and have 6 categories. It is important to not that
          both Gross Domestic Profit and Social Support are weighted using the gallup system.</p>
        
        <p>The visualisation is zoomable while hovering the mouse, and allows users to select based on region and filter based on minimum
          happiness scores. Also while hovering mouse on points, individual stats of the points corresponding country while be shown. </p>

          <h2>A General Distribution</h2>
          <p>The Heatmap to the right, plots the records of all the countries from the years 2015-2022, depending
            on their score for freedom of choice, which relates to individuals level of choice in making decisions
            in their lives, and a countries happiness score, from this the user can deduce which pair of scores are
            most likely to be attained and the general distribution of how many countries have both a high freedom 
            of choice and happiness score, as Freedom of choice is not as an important factor as the others detailed above.</p>
          
          <p>Using the filter bar selects minimum happiness score, and also in parallel zooms into distribution while updating 
            count of records scale. </p>

        <p>Before we delve into the composition of the scores and how they differ by region, lets take a step back and see the
          scores per country, represented on a world map. </p>
        <p>Hovering over a country will show its Happiness Score and using the slider we can filter by setting a range of minimum scores. </p>
